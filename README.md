# Open Know-How Search

A publicly editable CSV file and associated [search page][] for open source hardware projects that have an [OpenKnowHow manifest][standard].

Open Know-How wants to make hardware projects easy to find (there are more than 80 different platforms/repositories for hardware available out there!). To do that, a group of people has come up with a manifest, a little file that goes into each project documentation, and that can be found by webcrawlers.

Adding your project to [our list](projects_okhs.csv) will make it show up on [search.openknowhow.org][search page] and also make sure it is found by any future Open Know-How crawlers.

## Adding your project

1. Add a manifest to your project (see the [example manifest](okh-YourHardwareName.yml))
2. Check it using our [validator][]
2. Add a URL to the .yml to [our CSV](projects_okhs.csv)
