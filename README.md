# Open Know-How Search

Open Know-How wants to make hardware projects easy to find (there are more than 80 different platforms/repositories for hardware available out there!). To do that, a group of people has come up with a manifest, a little file that goes into each project documentation, and that can be found by webcrawlers.


## Problem?

If you have any questions, [create an issue](https://github.com/OpenKnowHow/okh-log/issues/new), or drop a message to andremaia.chagas[at]gmail.com
